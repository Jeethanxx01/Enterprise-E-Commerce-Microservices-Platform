## üîÑ Service Interaction Flows with Kafka

### Order Processing Flow

1.  **User** initiates the process by sending a request to the **CartService** to add an item.
2.  **User** proceeds to checkout, sending a request to the **CartService**.
3.  The **CartService** sends a request to the **OrderService** to place the order (via REST API).
4.  The **OrderService** saves the new order details to the **Order DB**.
5.  The **OrderService** publishes an "order-placed" event to **Kafka**.
6.  **Kafka** delivers the event to the **ProductService**, which consumes it.
7.  The **ProductService** updates the stock quantity for the item in the **Product DB**.

### Order Cancellation Flow

1.  **User** initiates the cancellation by sending a request to the **OrderService**.
2.  The **OrderService** updates the order status to 'cancelled' in the **Order DB**.
3.  The **OrderService** publishes an "order-cancelled" event to **Kafka**.
4.  **Kafka** delivers the event to the **ProductService**, which consumes it.
5.  The **ProductService** increments the stock quantity for the cancelled item in the **Product DB**.

### Review Analysis Flow

1. **User** submits a review through the **Product Service**
2. **Product Service** sends the review to the **Review Analysis Service**
3. **Review Analysis Service** processes the review using Google's Gemini AI
4. Analysis results are returned to the **Product Service**
5. If the review is valid, it's saved to the database
6. If invalid, a 400 Bad Request is returned with analysis details

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### ELK Stack Integration
- **Centralized Logging**: All microservices logs are collected and processed
- **Logstash Configuration**: Custom patterns for structured logging
- **Elasticsearch**: Efficient log storage and indexing
- **Kibana**: Real-time log visualization and analysis

  {
      "is_relevant": true/false,
      "message": "Overall analysis explanation",
      "analysis": {
          "direct_relevance": "Explanation of relevance",
          "content_quality": "Explanation of content quality",
          "inappropriate_content": "Explanation of inappropriate content",

      }
  }
  ```

### Test Cases for AI Review Analysis

Here are some example test cases demonstrating the AI service's ability to analyze reviews:

1. **Valid Product Review**
   ```json
   {
     "product_title": "Premium Almonds",
     "product_description": "Organic, handpicked almonds rich in nutrients and flavor",
     "review": "These almonds are really good"
   }
   ```
   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "is_relevant": true,
     "message": "The review is related to the product as it expresses a general positive sentiment towards \"Premium Almonds\". However, it lacks detail and provides no specific information about the taste, quality, or benefits. It doesn't contain any inappropriate content."
   }
   ```

2. **Spam Review**
   ```json
   {
     "product_title": "Premium Almonds",
     "product_description": "Organic, handpicked almonds rich in nutrients and flavor",
     "review": "Get awesome mobile cover at 50% off ‚Äì link inside!"
   }
   ```
   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "is_relevant": false,
     "message": "The review is not relevant to the product Premium Almonds. It's promoting a mobile accessory with a suspicious link, indicating it is likely spam."
   }
   ```

3. **Inappropriate Content**
   ```json
   {
     "product_title": "Premium Almonds",
     "product_description": "Organic, handpicked almonds rich in nutrients and flavor",
     "review": "racial slur"
   }
   ```
   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "is_relevant": false,
     "message": "The review is completely unrelated to the product Premium Almonds. It contains highly inappropriate and offensive language and does not provide any relevant feedback. Such content is not acceptable."
   }
   ```
